Developer Portfolio

 Introduction

Hey there! I'm Fasil KT — a passionate web developer exploring both frontend design and backend functionality. This portfolio is a reflection of my journey so far, showcasing the projects I've built and the skills I've picked up along the way. I'm focused on creating clean, responsive websites that are easy to navigate and visually appealing, with a touch of backend logic to make things work smoothly.
